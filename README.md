# Web Stock Scraper

This is a very exaggerated and unnecessary way of implementing a simple web scraper that will periodically check if an item is in stock. But, I have no social life so might as well over-engineer something for vibes. After all, don't we all want to be 10x engineers ðŸ™‚

## How It Works

1. **AWS EventBridge Trigger**: An EventBridge event triggers the Lambda function every 5 minutes.
2. **Lambda Function**: The Lambda function makes a request to check if the item is in stock.
3. **Check Stock**: If the item is in stock, the Lambda function publishes a message to an AWS SNS topic.
4. **SNS Subscription**: There is a subscription (Pub/Sub) to the SNS topic that sends out an email informing about the item's availability.

## CI/CD Components

- **CloudWatch Logs**: Logs are generated for Lambda function invocations and events.
- **GitHub**: The source code is stored in GitHub for version control.
- **CDK and CloudFormation**: Infrastructure is defined as code using CloudFormation or CDK.
- **CodeBuild**: CodeBuild is used for building and testing the code.
- **CodePipeline**: CodePipeline automates the CI/CD process.
